> This work is hauntingly emotional. The face of complete & utter despair.
> It is primarily **browns** & **blacks** & **tans** & **white**: This
> palette highlights the fact that Lucretiaâ€™s **Night gown** is **blood
> stained** from her suicidal stabbing. You can fairly see the lifeâ€™s
> blood draining from her in her final moments. It is extremely powerful
> emotionally.
