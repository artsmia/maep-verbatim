> The coral cutlery set consists of a single knife and fork. They are
> made delicately out of gold and silver, with a great deal of fancy 16th
> century decoration and embellishments. However, all this decoration is
> outshone- to the point of looking insignificant – by the luminous red
> branch of coral crowning each utensil. The coral is in its natural
> form- like miniature red trees- but polished until they shine with
> white highlights. The care and expense that went into making them is
> obvious, they are treasures. Yet despite everything, they still manage
> to seem like an everyday object, recognizable and familiar despite
> being old and extremely ornate.
