artist: Eugene Carrière

> In a large oil painting, two women are portrayed. The artist used muted
> reds and browns. The first woman is in the foreground, sitting &
> leaning to the left of the frame, with her head resting in the crook of
> her fist and thumb. She is looking sort of sadly at something to the
> right. The woman directly behind her is also looking at the mysterious
> thing to the right. The second woman appears directly to the left of
> the first. The whole painting is sort of obscured, like you’re looking
> at them through a dusty window. It’s contemplative & sort of sad.
