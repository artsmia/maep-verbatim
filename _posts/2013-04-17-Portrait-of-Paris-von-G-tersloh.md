> Young accountant-looking man in chino-type pants + oxford shirt. Rust +
> orange + brown/ red w/ gold hints is color scheme. He is sitting on a
> small sofa type chair, hands up @ shoulder level His eyes look a bit
> dazed + wild. The texture of the brush strokes is a little frenetic
> energy. His body + clothes are all outlined in black adding a crisp
> pronounced young energy. His ocean blue tie matches the chaotic energy
> that seems to border on the edges of passion, frustration, youthful
> vigor, and anger.
