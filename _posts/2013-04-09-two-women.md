> In a large oil painting, *two women* are portrayed. The artist used
> **muted** **reds** and **browns**. The first woman is in the foreground,
> sitting & leaning to the left of the frame, with her head resting in the
> crook of her **fist** and **thumb**. She is looking sort of sadly at
> something to the right. The woman directly behind her is also looking at
> the mysterious thing to the right. The second woman appears directly to
> the left of the first. The **whole painting** is sort of *obscured*,
> like you’re looking at them through a dusty window. It’s contemplative &
> sort of sad.
