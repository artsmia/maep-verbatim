> Young accountant-looking man in chino-type pants + oxford shirt.
> Rust+orange+brown/red w/ gold hints is color scheme. He is sitting on a
> small sofa-type chair, hands up @ shoulder level. His eyes look a bit
> dazed + wild. The texture of the brush strokes has a little frenetic
> energy. His body + clothes are all outlined in black adding a crisp
> pronounced young energy. His ocean blue tie matches the chaotic energy
> that seems to border on the ??? of passion, frustration, youthful vigor
> + anger.
