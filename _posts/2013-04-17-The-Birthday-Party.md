> The painting is about two feet by two and a half feet. This oild
> painting is impressionistically rendered. The brush strokes appear
> loose and fast. The work is set in a room that features walls which are
> painted a deep red. It is night, as indicated by two twin windows seen
> in the left part of the painting. The central figure is a fair-skinned
> and corpulent mother clad in a fine red dress. She is seated at a white
> clothed dining table that is filled with glassware. The dining table is
> off-center and continues outside the picture plane on the right. The
> mother is cutting a cake for her androgynous child who is seated on her
> left (appearing in the right corner of the composition). The child’s
> face is lit up by birthday candles on the cake. The child stares
> intently into the flames of the candles. Directly behind the mother
> stands a ominous man who is wearing all black. Perhaps he is the
> father. He is dark skinned, bald, and has a beard and moustache. He
> lacks all facial features. Light seems to be emanating from behind him,
> perhaps he is blocking a wall sconce. There is a lamp in the upper
> right hand corner, which is cut off by picture plane. It is quite large
> in scale to the figures, which makes it seem close to the viewer. The
> Lamp features an Asian inspired lampshade that portrays a carp on side,
> and a bamboo tree on another. The overwhelming use of red, the off
> centered elements of the composition, and the mysterious male figure
> leaves the viewer with an uneasy feeling. This is not the most joyous
> of birthday parties.
