> This work is hauntingly emotional. The face of complete & utter
> despair. It is primarily browns & blacks & tans & white: This palette
> highlights the fact that Lucretia’s Night gown is blood stained from
> her suicidal stabbing. You can fairly see the life’s blood draining
> from her in her final moments. It is extremely powerful emotionally
