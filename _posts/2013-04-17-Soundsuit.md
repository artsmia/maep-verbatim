> A life-sized human form--a sculpture--is completely covered in
> patchwork crocheted pieces. All colors present, the pieces sizes of
> doilies or square oven mitts, lacey in detail and full of flower
> patterns. Only the hands and heels of the black plastic-mold human form
> are visible under the crocheted work, which fits like a claustrophobia
> --inducing, homemade grandmotherly sock. Starting at mid-torso on the
> body, metal poles (1/4 in diameter) poke out from the body. At the end
> of the curving poles are 40 or so colorful, antique toys--
> jack-in-the-boxes, bells, drums-–all small scary garish children’s
> instruments. it feels like a circus and a grandma’s living room.
