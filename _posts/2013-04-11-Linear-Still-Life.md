> This rectangle painting is horizontally place with only 7 objects on a
> white background. Just under the center line all the way to the left is
> half of a slanted box (slanted the top to the right) about an inch to
> the right is an identical, full sized box. Above the half box is ¼ box
> filled in black. On the right of the work is a full black box, on the
> same visual line as the other black filled box. Under is a circle and a
> slanted outlined box, on the same line as the first described box. Just
> to the left of the center line is an oval which drips from the top of
> the work by a thin black outline. The piece is framed with a thin
> silver frame and black lattice.
