title: Frank
artist: Chuck Close
---

> This painting is monochromatic- consisting of blacks, whites, and greys.
> Despite having a lack of variation in color, the blacks and whites
> portray many different textures, shades, and materials. Overall, the
> painting is precise and real. It almost resembles a photograph. Details
> such as stray hairs, reflection in the glasses, freckles, eyelashes etc.
> contribute to the painting’s sense of reality. Frank looks stoic and
> composed, yet he also looks pensive. As I look into his almost black
> eyes, I can images he has a story to tell.
