> Oil on canvas. This painting is about 3’tall x 5’wide. A black frame
> with intricate ridges. In the background on the far side of the pond
> sits a little cottage with a watermill. The roof is orange and the wall
> behind the wheel is white. A reflection of the mill glimmers on the
> pond. White and grey clouds pile up in the blue sky above the mill. On
> either side of the mill stand green trees a little taller than the
> mill, also casting their reflection in the pond. In the foreground a
> hunter in a red coat bears a rifle. He is aiming his rigle across the
> pond in the direction of the wood on the left of the mill. To the right
> of the hunter the trees tower to the top of the frame and to the right
> edge of the frame. A wooden rail fence borders the bottom edge of the
> painting. The canopies of the trees stretch as wide as the trees are
> tall. The tree trunks in the foreground are white from the forest floor
> to midway below the first branches. The reflection of the canopies
> reaches from the foremost tree, to the fence. The hunter stands on the
> shore in the middle of the reflection of the canopy of the foremost
> tree on his right.
